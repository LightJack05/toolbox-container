# Toolbox container for debugging

This container is a toolbox for debugging whereever containers run.
It contains a lot of tools as well as a competent autocompleting zsh shell so you can debug without having to copy-paste commands just to understand the output.

## PRs welcome!
If you need another tool, or you have an improvement for the shell or interface, open a PR and make this toolkit more useful!
